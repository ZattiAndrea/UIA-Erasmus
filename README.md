## Repository Structure

This repo hosts content for three courses I took at UiA. Each folder contains lab work and project material.


There was also a fourth course with its own dedicated repository:

- **Programming and Software Development** ‚Üí üëâ [Link to the separate repository](https://github.com/ZattiAndrea/Sloot_Zatti_MAS417)

## Courses

### 1) AI-Mathematics
This course builds the mathematical toolbox needed to model, analyze, and optimize modern ML systems. You‚Äôll connect probability (random variables, conditional rules), linear algebra, and numerical optimization to core ML tasks such as maximum-likelihood estimation, regression, classification evaluation, and dimensionality reduction. The module also introduces game-theoretic reasoning, dynamical systems (deterministic and stochastic state-space models), and Markov chains, so you can formulate time-dependent problems and reason about their evolution in practice.

**What I did:** Each week the professor assigned exercises aligned with the lecture topics‚Äîsome purely mathematical (pen-and-paper), others coding-oriented‚Äîplus short reading-based reports on selected papers. In this repo you‚Äôll find the code for every assignment and one final report that consolidates the work completed across the semester.

### 2) Deep Neural Network
The course aims to make you proficient at designing, training, and evaluating neural models end-to-end. Starting from the theoretical foundations of layers, activations, and optimizers, you progress to building feed-forward, convolutional, recurrent, autoencoder, and GAN architectures, learning when and why to use each. Emphasis is on practical proficiency‚Äîconfiguring pipelines, diagnosing under/overfitting and data issues, and delivering industry-relevant implementations with sound experimental analysis.

**What I did:** After the initial theory block, we moved to a hands-on lab format with six weekly assignments, each tied to that week‚Äôs topic. The course concluded with a larger project; my team tackled **bird-voice (birdsong) recognition**, experimenting with newer models and approaches for the task and achieving excellent results.

### 3) Generative Programming
This course develops the skills to describe, analyze, and implement languages and their tooling. You learn model-driven development and the treatment of structural, syntactic, and semantic aspects to design high-level language descriptions, then turn those models into working artifacts through compiler techniques and code generation. By the end, you can translate between grammars, languages, and automata, and engineer generators and processors that raise the level of abstraction in software development.

**What I did:** Although the course was mainly theoretical, the report in this repo summarizes my work on an existing project to extend and update features of a language for building **Petri nets**. You can find the official project repository here: [uiano/Petrinet](https://github.com/uiano/Petrinet).
